Electric Aircraft Configuration Evaluation
Copyright 2017-2021 The MathWorks, Inc.

These example models enable you to use simulation to evaluate electric 
and hybrid electric architectures against design criteria such
as flight range and flight duration.  The models are parameterized so
that you can modify many aspects of the design, including automatic
parameter sweeps of battery size and payload.
