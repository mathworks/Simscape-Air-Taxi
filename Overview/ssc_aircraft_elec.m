%% Electric Aircraft Component Sizing
%
% This example models an electric aircraft power network.  It can be used
% to evaluate component sizes with respect to design requirements.
%
% Electric aircraft is an active area of development in the aerospace
% industry. Simulation can accelerate the process of selecting power
% network architectures and sizing components.  This simulation model
% enables rapid exploration of the design space and comparison to design
% criteria, which reduces the number of design iterations and ensures the
% final design meets system-level requirements. 
%
% In this example, aircraft configurations, power networks, and component
% sizes are all parameterized using MATLAB. You can test a single-seat
% light aircraft (such as Airbus E-Fan), double-seat light aircraft (such
% as Pipistrel Alpha Electro), or a custom design. Design parameters, such
% as battery capacity and payload mass, can be swept over a set of values
% to determine which combinations will meet flight range requirements.  A
% separate model enables a comparison with a hybrid-electric architecture.

%% Model
%
% The electric aircraft model includes a battery, two DC networks, and a
% mechanical model of the aircraft which acts a load on the high voltage DC
% network.  The low voltage DC network includes a set of loads that turn on
% and off during the flight cycle.

%% Aircraft Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the aircraft as a load on the motor.  This abstract
% model assumes that the pilot takes the actions necessary to follow the
% desired flight cycle, set by alpha (angle of attack) and gamma (flight
% path angle with respect to the earth reference frame).  It calculates the
% required thrust to maintain the lift to follow the flight cycle.  The
% mechanical power required to deliver this thrust is calculated and
% converted to the load torque on the motor shaft.

%% Load Torque Subsystem
%
% This subsystem converts the required mechancial power into the load
% torque on the motor shaft.  This abstract model assumes that a specified
% amount of the motor's mechanical power is converted into thrust. Dividing
% the required power to maintain thrust by the motor speed results in the
% load torque on the motor shaft.  The motors control system adjusts to
% maintain the required shaft speed under the varying load.

%% Motor Subsystem
%
% This subsystem represents an electric motor and drive electronics
% operating in torque-control mode, or equivalently current-control mode.
% The motor's permissible range of torques and speeds is defined by a
